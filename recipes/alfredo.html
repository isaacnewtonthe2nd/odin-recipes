  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Simple, Creamy, and Flavorful. Those are the three words that describes this dish. Getting inspiration from Stanley Tucci's show, Searching for Italy, I found the Italian cusine to be a beginner friendly way to learn how to cook. </p>

  <p>The Fettuccine Alfredo was one of the first meals I learned to cook, and it would be an understatement to say I was impressed my the deep flavor. And to be honest, this dish boosted my confidence in the kitchen, because if I thought, if I could make such a masterpiece of a meal, I could whip up any other meals. However, I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious; Although, eating it here and there once in a while wouldn't hurt. We could all use a little cheat meal. </p>
