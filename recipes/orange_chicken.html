  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p class="description">I am 99% sure everyone has had orange chicken sometime in their lives. Whether is from Panda Express or PF-Changs, which I think makes the best version of this dish other than me. This Asian-Inspired dish is a popular item at Chinese restaurants in the USA.</p>

  <p class="description">It consists of small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in orange sauce. This is what creates the sticky, sweet, and delicious taste it has. If you want inspiration as to what a good orange chicken tastes like, I would try the one from PF Chang's. They actually use real oranges and add some slices to deepen the orangy flavour.</p>
